# onBudget
OnBudget is a JavaScript application making use of patterns such as Dependency Injection, whereas a large group of developers relay on frameworks like AngularJS for such simple patterns or have trouble understanding those out side of a framework usage; This app works a s PoC to a Vanilla approach to help understand how some things work.

D3.v4, CSS3, SVG, HTML, JavaScript are the only technologies required in this application in their Vanilla flavor, proving that much can be achieved without frameworks dependencies like jQuery, Bootstrap among other popular dependencies commonly found on most projects.

## Run the app
Given the simplicity involved you can open the index.html straight from your file system or you could use a small server like live-server if it means no extra effort for you.

## About the app
OnBudget allows you to input incomes and expenses live, so that you can see how much budget you have left.
